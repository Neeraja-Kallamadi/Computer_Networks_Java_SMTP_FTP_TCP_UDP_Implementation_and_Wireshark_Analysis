# IMPLEMENTATION OF STMP, FTP, TCP, UDP USING JAVA AND ANALYSIS USING WIRESHARK

This project encompasses a range of network communication scenarios in Java. It showcases capabilities such as sending emails with file attachments using the JavaMail API, configuring SMTP settings, and handling 
exceptions during the email sending process. Additionally, it illustrates a basic FTP client that connects to a server, divides and sends a file in parts, and keeps track of the transfer progress, along with a 
complementary FTP server that receives files and displays transfer progress. Furthermore, the project demonstrates client-server interactions over a TCP connection, where a client sends messages to a server, receives
responses, and closes the connection. Lastly, there are two UDP components: a client that sends messages and receives responses, and a server that receives messages, responds, and closes the socket. These various 
programs collectively serve as a comprehensive exploration of fundamental networking concepts, making them valuable tools for learning network communication in Java.

Wireshark is an invaluable tool in this project, offering a comprehensive view of network communication processes such as SMTP, FTP, TCP, and UDP. For SMTP, it reveals detailed SMTP conversations, aiding in 
diagnosing email delivery issues. In FTP transfers, it tracks file transfers, file sizes, and data integrity, ensuring smooth data exchange. When dealing with TCP interactions, Wireshark provides insights into 
packet flow, sequence numbers, and acknowledgments, helping to identify connectivity or reliability problems. For UDP communication, it assists in confirming the successful exchange of datagrams. Additionally, 
Wireshark's statistical analysis capabilities empower the evaluation of network performance metrics, offering valuable insights into data transfer rates, round-trip times, and packet loss rates. This statistical 
analysis aids in optimizing networked applications by identifying bottlenecks, latency issues, and areas for improvement. Overall, Wireshark's ability to dissect these protocols enhances our understanding of 
network communication and plays a pivotal role in troubleshooting and optimizing networked applications within this project.
